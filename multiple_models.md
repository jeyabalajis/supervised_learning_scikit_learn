# Evaluating Multiple Models

## Some guiding principles
- Size of the dataset
  - Fewer features, simpler model
  - Some models require large amounts of data 
- Interpretability
  - Some models are easier to explain, which can be important to stakeholders
  - Linear Regression has high interpretability, as we can understand the co-efficients 
- Flexibility
  - May improve accuracy, by making fewer assumptions about the data
  - KNN is a more flexible model, does not assume any linear relationships
 
> Metrics is key to choose models.
> Regression model performance: RMSE, R-Squared
> Classification model performance: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC AUC
